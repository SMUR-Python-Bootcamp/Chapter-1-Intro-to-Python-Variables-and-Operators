    "\n",
    "### 📝 Submitting Your Work (GitHub Classroom Autograder)\n",
    "- Practice and test your code in this notebook as much as you like.  \n",
    "- For grading, you must:  \n",
    "  1. Put your final solutions into the required **`.py` file(s)** in your GitHub Classroom repository.  \n",
    "  2. Follow the naming conventions and function signatures exactly as instructed.  \n",
