- For grading, you must:  
  1. Put your final solutions into the required **`.py` file(s)** in your GitHub Classroom repository.  
  2. Follow the naming conventions and function signatures exactly as instructed.  
  3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.  
  4. The **autograder will run automatically** on your pushed code and report back your score.
